    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Adding an egg to your regular oatmeal not only ups the protein content, but also makes for an extremely thick and creamy bowl of oatmeal. Mixing in peanut butter, banana, and bacon just makes it even better.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large egg </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon milk </li>
        <li>1 cup milk, or more as needed </li>
        <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract </li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon </li>
        <li>1 pinch salt </li>
        <li>1 pinch ground nutmeg </li>
        <li>½ cup rolled oats  </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon maple syrup </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon peanut butter, or to taste </li>
        <li>½ banana, sliced </li>
        <li>1 slice cooked bacon, crumbled </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk egg with 1 tablespoon milk in a small bowl. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Bring 1 cup milk, vanilla extract, cinnamon, salt, and nutmeg to a boil in a saucepan over medium-low heat, stirring often. Mix in oats and cook until thickened, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour beaten egg mixture slowly into the oats, stirring constantly. Continue cooking until egg is fully cooked and oatmeal is very thick and creamy, about 5 minutes. Add additional milk if oatmeal gets too thick.</li>
        <li>Pour oatmeal into a heat-proof bowl; mix in maple syrup and peanut butter. Top with banana slices and crumbled bacon.</li>
    </ol>
