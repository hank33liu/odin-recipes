# odin-recipes
This project is the first assigned to me by The Odin Project (TOP).

We have only covered the basics of creating a repository (repo) on GitHub, cloning to our local machine, staging our repo, and committing.  as well as basic HTML structure.

The idea with this project is to reinforce that work loop on GitHub by reinforcing our HTML learning. We'll practice using lists, bold text, itacilized text, paragraphs, images, etc.

Hopefully by the end of this, we'll be prepared to move on to more complicated topics.
